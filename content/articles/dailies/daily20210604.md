I am doing this post in order to force myself to do a post.

I have hit that wall that I often hit on projects after a few months of working on it.

I'm excited to work on stuff for my Girlfriend's birthday this weekend.

I also want to do some work on my research project.

We finally have made some progress in the poddcasting world. Three guests, three yes'.

The creeping feeling of depression is really hard to fight.

I am struggling to claw my way out of that well and keep working on things I think are important.

Keep fighting the good fight and remember how good it feels to be excited.

Douglas
