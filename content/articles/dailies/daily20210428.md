Woke up and did some Stanford lectures.
Worked, worked out, did a warm shower for the first time in a minute.
Core is becoming a limiting factor, I think after each crossfit workout I need to start doing some core on my own.

Finished lecture 3 of Stanford's Meta-learning class. Time for the HW.

Gotta get some stuff done for work tomorrow and finish this up. Otherwise... Time for Hawaii!!

The last couple weeks have been a blast.

I'm looking forward to more like them.

Chase what excites you.
Douglas
