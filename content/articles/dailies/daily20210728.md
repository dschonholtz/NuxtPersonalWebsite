Today I went on a youtube bender on a scale I do not care to admit.

I still did most of my things.
I did my morning routine. But I wasn't as productive when I should have so I guiltily kept working when I shouldn't.

I need to remember the newish goal of trying to make sure I inject some fun into the day that isn't staring at videos of other people doing things.
