Holy crap I did it.

I got the podcast up and alive at www.scifitoreality.com
Neil's episode is officially live and it has even been seen by Neal Stephenson.

I'm real tired though.
The sleep game is tough. I don't know how to get more than 7 hours of sleep when grinding like this.

I'm also not sure how to prioritize the podcast, gradschool, working out and this. I get maybe two of those with the job.

In any case, I'm really excited to have shipped.

There also are a few build errors here. I'm not gonna fix them now. But maybe tomorrow?
Instead of workign out I stretched today.
Back to lifting tomorrow.

Should be fun :)
