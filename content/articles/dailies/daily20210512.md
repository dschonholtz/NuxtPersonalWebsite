I am still jetlagged as hell and I didn't manage to get up until 8 am.
However, after that I did the following:

* Stretched
* Meditated
* Envisioned my whole day
* Did my mantra 
* Went over my long term goals
* Did a decent job at work
* Worked out (15.7 strain on the Whoop)
* Had a healthy dinner
* Made progress on the ML homework I've been procrastinating for nearly two weeks
* Updated this website.

I think I am back on the good habit train for the most part.
The next big hurdle is getting up early again so I can have my mornings back.

I'm excited to feel in control of my life again and to be excited about my longer goals and not just be overwhelmed with my individual day again.

I'm going to keep chasing being excited as always.
