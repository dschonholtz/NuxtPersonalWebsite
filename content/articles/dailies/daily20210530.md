A good day. 
I haven't been exercising as much in prep for the crossfit murph workout which is finally tomorrow.

I have a research idea. 
In the world models paper, the agents trained in their dreams to some extent.

When they are training in the real world, when they fail, I want to send the agent back to just before that moment in the latent space and replay that moment with different actions and have the agent dream through it. I want the agent to learn why something happens good or bad.

I am going to try to do that tomorrow.

It should be very exciting.

Lots of minor good pieces of progress in the podcast today.

Exciting stuff.
Good to be chasing excitement again :)
