Today was relatively mediocre. I think seeing the low recovery scores on the whoop actually encourage the slacker in me to go ahead and to cave to the feeling that I should take a break when I might normally power through.

But I am going to sleep early tonight in hopes of finally getting that recovery score up again.

Today I didn't do any ML or PH.D. prep work, but I did finally get a final version of our pre-episode of our podcast out.

That feels fantastic, because we can now start sending out emails to folks to try to get them on the show since we have done a full episode and think we know approximately what that will be like.

Sadly, I think that is all of the podcasting stuff I'm going to do for this week since I really need to catch up with ML stuff.

Good night.

And as always chase what excites you.
