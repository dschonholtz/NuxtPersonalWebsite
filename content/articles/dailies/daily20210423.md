Woke up around 7:30 started with some peaks at the Stanford Multi-task and meta-learning class.
Did some work.

I got my whoop today. there is an unofficial API for that and it might be interesting to find a place to stream some of that data here. it definitely has been a relatively large distraction, but it will also definitely improve my workouts.

I also am getting more and more sure that I want to break this site into two sub-domains. ML and Health. One focusing on my machine learning education and the other being about my personal fitness and health goals.

I didn't spend any time today working on the podcast. I really am going to have to devote some serious time tomorrow to that, on top of continuing with the meta-learning class.

I'm excited to work out harder and to delve deeper into ML.

And as always. Chase what excites you.
