It's been a few days since I posted but I have been experimenting with a new routine that has continued to be sustainable which has been great.

The biggest thing that has slipped is this website.

The routine is very similar to the rest of my routine with a few important changes.

I moved my workouts to after work.
This way in the morning I do a quick workout on my own on my own time to get ready for the day without working out in a fugue state. 

It also means that once I need a reset to get to work after my salaried job is done I get one from a hard workout from crossfit.

This has been great.

I also have been then working immediately after that workout until 8 pm. I then spend 8 to 10 with my friends and family.

That way I am not dropping social commitments and am still accomplishing what I need to accomplish.

I also have found the best way to handle my various commitments, machine learning, this website, and the podcast is to cycle them so I only handle one of them a day and make a decent dent in it.

No multitasking. Just focus.

Lots of progress the last few days.

I'll have to go back to making this a habit just at 8 pm now.

Should be fun :)
