Back on the horse...
And I feel tired.

I'll be curious to see if I'm just burned out after a week of this.

I successfully did the full daily routine.

I got all of the branding for the podcast SciFi to Reality done and it looks like we'll be launching this week.

We probably won't be launching with three episodes but fuck it. Let's get it into the world.

I'm exhausted, been going hard in some capacity since 6:20 am and it is 10:09. Gonna go read the vital few and pass out.

Oh, not quite true, I did slack off for an hour in the middle of the day. I should feel more rested given that... I should find more effective ways to be a lazy butt I guess :)

I'm really excited about the podcast and the recent workout gains I've made. 

Grad school feels weird to me now... I dunno. I might go get the econ or ml masters. We'll see. Maybe a phd who knows.

Stay excited. Work hard. Or at the very least go have fun :)

Douglas
