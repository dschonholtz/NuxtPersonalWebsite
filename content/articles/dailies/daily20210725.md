It is has been over a month!

My ability to focus, my interest in workouts, my interest in ML, and my general mental health have all declined.

I need to start meditating again, restart the daily routine with this as my accountability partner. 

I also need to make sure I spend time being social, and not just on the computer.

In other news this is being co-written by AI-copilot which is interesting. 

Mental toughness is essential and it is one of my new top priorities.

I want to hit my daily routine every day, but also to have fun within those constraints. 

To keep myself honest here, I am going to post my deviations here and how I had fun in my constraints for the day.

Tomorrow will be day one as tomorrow always is. I am starting a new job so I'll have to be focused.

I also need to stay focused on the podcast and getting my masters in machine learning, and possibly in economics.

I also am considering adding a blog section called Doug's Daily 'Deas where I post a new company idea every day.
