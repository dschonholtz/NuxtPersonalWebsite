In yesterdays post I outlined why the next four days were going to be insane.

Today I filtered out all of Ml faculty at cornel and MIT down to just ~15% of the faculty at both places. With the remaining folks, I need to go through and read their research to know if they are really working on what I want to work on.

I also got through the big ticket podcasting items, new intro recorded, music selected, new outro recorded, Michael and I agreed we could send emails.
I said I would put those pieces together and upload the final finished podcast for that episode and tomorrow we'll begin drafting emails and nailing down what research we want to do for speaking with our academic professionals.

I also am on a flat 6 hours of sleep and have a strain of 15.1 according to my whoop which is concerning.

I'm gonna sleep. Tomorrow more ML. More podcast. More excitement. good night.
