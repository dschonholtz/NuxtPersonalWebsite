It's funny. In my last post I had a lengthy list of things to do the next day and I believe I did all of them.

Sadly, that post from two weeks ago did not include updating this and didn't...

This week we are going to try hitting the daily routine again hard.

I have made some half hearted attempts recently, but no serious, ok I'm going to do this, because this is what I do attempts. 

For deep work session one, I will go through and draft up questions for our second podcast guest.

In my shallow work session I'll send those to him with my partner.

I'll keep training my neural network.

I also will read at least one research paper talking about either hindsight analysis in reinforcement learning OR about environment reconstruction with reinforcement learning networks.

I'll be working out at 9 am.

So from 6 to 9 I'll be working instead of working out, but otherwise this should be the same.
