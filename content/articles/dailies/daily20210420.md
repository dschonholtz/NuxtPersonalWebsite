- 7:00 AM Woke up
- Light run to workout
    - Finally listening to an audio book
- Workout was good. Running, pull ups, push ups, air squats
    - Finally starting to get kipping on the pull ups, need to work my push ups and shoulder mobility
- Shower, mantra
- 9:30 AM start work
- 6:00 PM - 9:30 PM Podcast work (Announcement coming soon)
- Vegged out until 11. 


# What was good today
* Lots of podcast work. There is so much to do here
* good to finally be listening to an audio book

# What could be better
* Doing the blog, the ML research, working out and the podcast is definitely more than enough for full time work. It is tempting to quit and to just work on these things to attempt to scale them and start making money from them. I have the finances to support myself while launching.
