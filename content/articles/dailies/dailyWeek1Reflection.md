Spending 30 minutes everyday, at the end of my day, reflecting on that day has been very helpful. I spend the whole day knowing that my day will become publicly available to a large extent at the end of it. That accountability has been essential. That being said, I ended up not writing anything for Saturday or Sunday of this week. That flies in the face of my two day rule and the fact that this is only my first week of attempting to write something very brief every day.

In the future, I will have to find a way to still hold myself accountable and to write up what I have done for the day very briefly even if I have traveled across the country to go drinking for a friends birthday. I think being honest about what I am up to is important for myself even if it arguably wouldn't build the best image in the short term.

I think this will ensure that I become who I want to be and forces me to take off the rose colored glasses to face the music perse.

I am very excited, because this week has been great in many senses. I have really sunk my teeth into machine learning in a way I arguably have not before, I am actually posting consistently to this website, and I have another project that currently dwarfs those other projects that will be announced shortly.

This has been fun, if challenging at times. It is very exciting.

Chase what excites you.
Douglas
