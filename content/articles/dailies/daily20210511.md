Things I didn't do today.

No workout.
No cold shower.
No Machine Learning work.
No podcasting work.
No morning meditation and mantra

I did go see a new place for rental purposes and work out with a friend of mine where I could end up.

Tomorrow I am going to wake up at 6:45 am and meditate, stretch and envision my whole day along with my mantra on goals.
I do think the goals aspect has been a big piece of my life that's been missing.

I also have a workout scheduled for after work so I should be good to go on workout and shower.

If I can do all of those things and then I can do some ML work the next morning we'll be back on track with the good habits.
