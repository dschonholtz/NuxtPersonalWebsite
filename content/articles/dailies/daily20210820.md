Here is what I said I'd do today yesterday:


* Wake up at 6:30.
* Stretch
* Meditate
* Run around the block
* Shower
* Get to work and work from 7 - 11
* Lunch
* Work from 11:30 - 3:30 or 4
* 3:30 - 4:30 Talk with Michael to prep for our 4:30 interview
* Interview 4:30 - 5:30
* 5:30 - 6:30 post mortem with Michael and talk about what we still need to do to release Aline's episode
* Meditate
* Run around the block
* Dinner
* update this site
* Read The first 90 days
* pass out.


I successfully woke up at 6:30 I didn't start work until 7:45 though.

I did a walk instead of a run.
After the 5:30 interview I went and did my weight lifting. I PR'd in the snatch (135) and almost PR'd in the Clean and Jerk.

I chatted with Michael after that, sent some emails played some Halo :)

So I didn't work or meditate quite as much as I'd like but everything else was about right.

Tomorrow is Saturday and if I don't say what I'm going to do here than I'll probably be lazy.


* Wake up at 7 am ish maybe 7:30.
* Breakfast, suppliments
* Crossfit at 9:30
* Eleuther problem! Get it done
* Break or finish it
* Then finish Aline intro. Possible get premiere... Do Aline Intro if needed.
* Release episode 2
* STRETCH!
