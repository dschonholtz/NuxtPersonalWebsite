Getting back on some of the daily habits feels good. It also makes me feel like I have infinite time since the time I do spend feels more productive.

Here is what I said I would try to do yesterday:

* I will be waking up for a 6:15 am work out for the first time in a while. I've been working out just mostly evenings which just isn't as good.
* I'll take a cold shower, been pretty good about this too recently.
* I will continue to work on understanding reinforcement learning techniques
  * Learned about LSTM's and GRU's in depth
* I will do the next step for moving in September
* I will do another post here

I did every single one of those items!

Tomorrow I can do even better by doing the following:

* Morning Mantra
* 5:30 pm workout. (The morning workouts are better but were booked lately)
* I'll take a cold shower
* I will continue to work on understanding reinforcement learning techniques and pick an ML project I can reasonably tackle
  * current candidates are:
  * Clustering of ML papers and procedurally labeling converging clusters and the convergances to spot up and coming research trends
  * Building an LSTM or GRU based agent that runs around in the openAI gym
* I will nail down what I am responsible for in Wednesday's meeting for the podcast
* I will do another post here
