I haven't been great about this. 
Trying to get back to it.

Today was good from a productivity perspective. 

* hung out with my parents who were in town from VT.
* Sent some emails to Podcast guests
* Recorded a podcast teaser
* Did a bunch of work for the podcast website/email
* Listened and counseled on a friend's game he is developing. I hope that comes to fruition so I can link it here some day.
* I started working through understanding LSTM's and GRU's
* I officially started some masters applications
* I did some work to set up the new place I am living in come September

Tomorrow:
* I will be waking up for a 6:15 am work out for the first time in a while. I've been working out just mostly evenings which just isn't as good.
* I'll take a cold shower, been pretty good about this too recently.
* I will continue to work on understanding reinforcement learning techniques
* I will do the next step for moving in September
* I will do another post here
