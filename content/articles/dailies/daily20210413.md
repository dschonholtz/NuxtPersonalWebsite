- 5:50 AM - Woke up
- 6:05 AM - Ran to gym
    - NEW PR! 4:49.31 previous record was 4:50.something I guess I need to track hundredths now.
- 6:15 - Workout
    - Front squats, chest to bar pull ups, sprinting, more front squats push ups
    - Big limiter is lifting volume. The strength is rapidly coming but I'm way down on volume still
    - need wrist brace thing for front rack wrist hurts after a few of these
    - Need to practice push ups
    - Front squat PR! 165
- Walked home
- Cold shower
- Booked flights to hawaii! woohoo esghedit. Pandemic be damned
- Started work relatively late. 
- Long walk with a friend talking about all sorts of good passion projects
- Research on VAE's discovered I had implimented some before technically in keras which is fun. Found some good examples to work off of and will be using to build some examples in pytorch.

# What was good today
- I loved every part of today. 

# What could be better
- Felt squeezed in the morning. No reflection meditation time
- The walk was great but I can't spend 3-4 hours hanging with friends like that every day.
- I need to devote some time to nailing down how hawaii will work both from this blog perspective and from a fitness and life perspective while still unplugging and relaxing while there.
