Today I woke up with the intention of realy trying to nail down the podcasting stuff so we could send emails getting folks on board for our first episodes.

I recorded an intro, made show notes, talked to my accomplicies about this episode and we are in a pretty good place.

I am going to be recording the sign off on the show and setting up a section of this site for future recordings tomorrow hopefully and then we'll be in business.

I didn't make any progress with the Stanford Meta-learning class today because of that. 

I would at least like to get through the two assigned papers for that tomorrow as well as wrapping up this podcast stuff.

It's an exciting place to be in.

Chase what excites you.
