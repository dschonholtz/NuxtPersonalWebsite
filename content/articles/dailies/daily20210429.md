I'm very tired. Likely because I didn't work out today. I also haven't been keeping up with the gratitude meditations and that's definitely been weighing on me, slowing me down, making me more easily frustrated judgemental etc.

That being said, I got my coworkers ready for my departure. I am ready to go to Hawaii and I did some more digging for potential PHD advisors.

Things are moving in the right direction, but because so much of today was vacation and work focused I feel like I didn't have time to get excited about the things I care more about. That feels a little frustrating.

That being said, I am very, very excited to go to hawaii tomorrow. And I am excited to start digging further into meta-learning in general.
The next thing on the docket is actually completing the first homework assignment. Since that all can be done in Google Collab notebooks, I think I should be able to find time to figure that out while on the island between hikes, beaches, massages and eating tropical fruit.

I think this week will be fantastic and that is very exciting.

Here's to chasing our excitement.

Douglas
