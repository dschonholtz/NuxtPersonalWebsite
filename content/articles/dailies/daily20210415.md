- 7:00 AM - As planned woke up no gym. 
- Tea/oatmeal planned Hawaii vacation
- No mental mantra
- Work
- Worked on upcoming podcast

# What was good today
- The podcast work was great. Everything is set there for Sunday recording session.
- All set for weekend trip to NYC

# What could be better
- I needed the day off from the workout, but days like today without the workout or the mantra, and I bring my phone downstairs with me while I'm working are bad from a mental health perspective.
- Wasn't very productive
- I need to work on VAE's tomorrow
- I need to spend more time just with Lauren. We are leaving for NYC Saturday and she is staying in NJ for the following week

This was a decent day, but it is a good reminder to stop and meditate when things are spiraling.
I have been having really dry eyes I think from too much screen time. It's really problematic.

Tomorrow I want to spend time with Lauren, work out, meditate, and work on VAE's.

As always, chase what excites you.
Douglas
