- 7:00 AM - As planned woke up no gym. 
- Tea/oatmeal talked with Lauren
- A little bit of mental mantra
- Work
- 4:00 PM used all of my suppliments for the first time to prep for my 5 pm workout
    - Creatine, BCAA's and Beta Alanine
- 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM - Worked out. Primarily focusing on Cleans. I got the form far better. The main helping factor was the reminder that I need to think of it as a backflip to get that hip drive. I also need to not widen the feet so much to quickly get under the bar.
- Planned my trip to NYC tomorrow.

# What was good today
- The workout was really fantastic
- I spent more time with Lauren
- I did some meditation stuff

# What could be better
- I still have been procrastinating some of the VAE/machine learning stuff. I am booked out now until Monday but I have Monday off. I will have to do it then.

As always, chase what excites you.
Douglas
