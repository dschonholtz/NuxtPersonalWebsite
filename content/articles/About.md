I really want to do things I find exciting. I want to do them well. I don't want to be depressed or bored and I want to surround myself with others that fill their life with that same excited energy.

This blog is about being productive and what I am working on. I find life hacking, machine learning and building software or working with small robots to fill that need.

I hope this inspires at least one other person to do whatever excites them.

The main page is a collection of larger projects I have worked on that I wanted a place to document publicly.

The daily page is a list of blog posts. It is kind of like a daily journal. It is a tool to keep me sane and publicly accountable for doing something worth doing every day.

Chase your excitement.
