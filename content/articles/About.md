I really want to do things I find exciting. I want to do them well. I don't want to be depressed or bored and I want to surround myself with others that fill their life with the same excitement.

This blog is about being productive and how I am keeping the demons at bay along with what is exciting to me. I find life hacking, machine learning and building things to fill that need for me.

I hope this inspires at least one other person to do whatever excites them.

Chase your excitement.
