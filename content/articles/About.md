I really want to do things I find exciting. I want to do them well. I don't want to be depressed or bored and I want to surround myself with others that fill their life with that same excited energy.

This blog is about being productive and what I am working on. I find life hacking, machine learning, economics, and building software to fill that need.

I hope this inspires at least one other person to do whatever excites them.

The <NuxtLink to="/">main page</NuxtLink> is a collection of larger projects I have worked on that I wanted a place to document publicly.

The <NuxtLink to="/daily">daily</NuxtLink> is a list of blog posts. It is kind of like a daily journal. It is a tool to keep me sane and publicly accountable for doing something worth doing every day.

The <NuxtLink to="/deas">Doug's Daily 'Deas</NuxtLink> section is a list of half baked ideas that I try to come up with on a regular basis. The goal is to find an economically viable way of applying a new technology to a serious problem. Some of these might get turned into real posts on the main page.

Chase your excitement.
