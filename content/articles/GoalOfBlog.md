# Why make a blog?

This blog is about the path of a complete novice attempting to become excellent at a small subset of things. The goal is to then publish that journey to get feedback, to see the error of my ways, and to help others along similar journeys. 

The list of things to start is as follows:

* Machine Learning
* Crossfit
* Building a successful podcast
* Building a successful website (This one!)

The path to do this is built on exponential progress. Make each change build on top of the previous change. This means making a very small positive impact towards one of those goals every. single. day.

Lots of very small changes might seem like a very slow and long way to mastery, but humans are bad at understanding exponential trends. Our minds inherently think linearly. With this in mind, we look for big linear jumps in progress, even if that means taking a long time between those jumps.

The problem with these occasional large jumps is they often are followed by progress atrophy and the next big jump does not necessarily build on the previous jump. 

What is far more valuable is to constantly look for small progress that builds on previous progress. This allows very effective exponential progress. The problem is this progress often feels slow. When thinking about it our brain expects this to be small linear progress that barely gets us anywhere. 

The reality is entirely different, we of course exponentially build on what we have learned. This constant incremental progress allows us to overcome nearly all obstacles. A classic example of this is seen from the Great Britainâ€™s cycling teams implementation of marginal change: https://www.lodenfrazecpas.com/the-aggregate-of-marginal-change/

By constantly applying small incremental changes to a small subset of goals one wants to master, one can in theory become world class at it. The problem is, in order to do that effectively. You have to track where those improvements are going and what they are. That is what this blog is about.
