The overarching reasons for making a blog boiled down to three major buckets. I wanted to keep my developer skills up to date on projects I wouldn’t otherwise be exposed to. I wanted to have a public place I could deploy microservices and finished projects to. Finally, I wanted to track all of the other things in my life I have going on. This would allow me to track my progress in them and to get them to a point where I would be comfortable sharing them with the world.

For developer skills, I wanted to learn a variety of things I wasn't otherwise using as much as I'd like. Using a modern JavaScript frontend framework, deploying things on my own, bash scripting, and kubernetes were some of the initial items. In this first iteration of my site, I have used Nuxt for it’s content management, being built upon the simplest of the major JS frameworks (Vue), and it's strength with content, and SEO optimization. More technical details and such and reasons behind the stack for this site can be found in my [Building This Blog](dailyprogress.dev/blog/BuildingThisBlog) post.

For my other projects I would like to track I am going to be starting with a few of my major interests. 

* Machine Learning
* Crossfit
* Building a podcast
* Building a website (Where you are now!)
* General Productivity Optimization

Then for each of those, I am going to attempt to improve each of them a tiny bit each day, document that progress here and hopefully achieve some level of exponential growth as that progress continuously compounds. The idea being, that if I can do that for an extended period of time, that exponential growth will eventually make me world class at each of those things.

If any of those things sounds interesting to you or you are trying to improve similar things I hope you will find this interesting and stick around for regular updates and to learn something new with me every day.
