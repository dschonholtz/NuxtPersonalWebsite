Economic Impact: Faster Research Iteration
Niche: Academic Research Analysis
New Technology: Bert, text mining,

This is an idea that has been bouncing around in my head for several months.

But here are the steps for making academics love you scrape arXiv.org or a similar research paper aggregator.

1. Push the first years scraped papers through [BerTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) or similar.
1. Take the resultant topics and then see how tied together the papers are based off of citation cross references.
1. Take the second years scraped papers (or whatever time interval you want) and run steps one and two again.
1. Do data analysis on the topics before and after. Find markers for why the topics are converging and see if you can catch the trend early.
1. Do steps 1-4 several times and eventually start predicting converging clusters of topics now that you have a training and test set of data.
1. From this now begin to look at modern day research and see if you can predict research for the next several months.

This all seems fairly tenable to me. 

The next step would be to read up on economic impacts of research and start to forecast economic fallout from these converging trends in research.

The whole reason I found this idea interesting, was that there has been shown that economic output can be massively increased through an uptick in R&D spending and efficiency. [^1] 

Although, that has been pointed out to be of questionable casuality. [^2]
