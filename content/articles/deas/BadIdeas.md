As per this new section of my website, this morning I was thinking of a few new ideas. I didn't want to forget them, as I now have, so I opened up the notes app on my phone and searched ideas since I guessed I had an old notepad of previous ideas on my phone. And boy did I...

Part of the joy of tracking your progress, is being able to see how far you've come. This is a list of ideas that I thought was good several years ago.

Admittedly, it looks like the purpose here was to brainstorm lots of ideas with the hopes that at least one of them was good... I do not think that goal was accomplished.

I think I might do a video reaction explaining this... But for now, I think I'll let this sit here with no justification.
I think it is hilarious.

The last one is probably my favorite.

The note's contents were as follows:
