Economic Impact: More productive technical firms that can hire at lower cost, Developers are hired based on quality of work and not for interviewing skill
Niche: Technical open source projects for companies willing to pay for open source devs
New Technology: Payment API, analytics,

Software engineers are like most employees locked into a given job once they start working somewhere. That being said, open source projects have been known to create extremely high quality code because so many eyes are on the associated projects, especially if the project is high value.
This idea, is that you could take traditionally closed companies that have very high respect from engineers, and open source the associated codebase. Then the company would put cash values on the associated tickets that need to be accomplished. Since anyone could sign up, provided they have some level of experience, the number of devs reviewing the code and attempting to solve the problem would be high. Devs would be able to work on projects they want to and get paid fairly for it, while companies would be able to see devs coding experience and output, meaning companies would be able to more accurately hire employees based on the exact type of work they did. This also means that for popular tech companies, hiring costs of software engineering labor would drop precipitously because lots of devs would be excited to say they had code working on a given project they would be excited about.

2 week prototype:
Chrome extension that uses a payments API and ties into Github. A code repository owner can then turn on payments for associated tickets. In the prototype, the payments would just be a ticket number in github that happens to be the same name. There wouldnâ€™t be any hard linkages.

You can tell this is an idea from a few years ago, because there is nothing purely technical about it. It is a business idea without any technical advantage which
is something that I try to stress in more recent ideas. I still think this might have legs as we see the tools for analytics for something like this coming to be possible. 

There isn't really a technical convergance that makes this possible, but we would need companies to be on board.

This would be an interesting idea to try because you could dog food the whole thing. Pay the devs that build it based on this model and see if it is economically feasible that way. It would also be interesting to talk to a microeconomist to see if there is a way you could roughly model out how you would go about doing this.
