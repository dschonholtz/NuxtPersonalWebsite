I do not do this every day. 
I strive to do this every day. Generally, speaking I think if you never fail a goal. It suggests your goals are pretty boring. This page will be evolving as I discover variants of my routine that work better for me.

My goal here that I generally am pretty good at accomplishing is to never miss any item on this list two days or more in a row. Matt D'Avella has a great video on the importance of this two day rule if you are interested.

But enough chat. Here is the routine for a normal day.

- 5:45-6:00 Wake Up.
  - I personally am a morning person. My hours before 11 am are my most productive so I try to be up early to do things and see people.
- Put on pants
- Run to a workout for 6:15 am while listening to an audio book
  - Despite being a morning person. Unless there is something really pressing I have to do, like an aggressive deadline. I find the best way I get up early is for a workout. The run is ~.7 Miles or 1.1 Km.
- 6:15 - 7:30 Workout 
  - Currently, my workout is crossfit, in the past it's been weightlifting, rock climbing, muay thai, or ski team dryland.
- Walk home while listening to that audio book
- Cold Shower
  - The benefits here are [many.](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-shower-benefits)
- 7:45 do a meditation and reflection
  - Do a mantra on gratitude and that I may die.
    - The goal here is to come to terms with the fact that life is short and that I'm a pretty lucky bastard. It also reminds me that life is to short to be working on things that I am not interested in and to always stear myself towards things I do care about.
  - Go over short (six months) and long term (5 years) goals
    - These are aggressive goals that if I work really hard I think are doable. Maybe after I work through the first six months and determine if the goals were good or not I'll publish them. For now I'm feeling a bit shy.
  - Go over my core principles
    - These are ideas that I want to associate with my identity that I want to strive to factor into my big life decisions.
    - Grit.
    - Gratitude.
    - Compassion.
    - The only way to raise the standard of living for all is through technology and expanding the economy. (Some liberal policies about wealth distribution might be helpful in the short term though.)
  - Imagine what my whole day from that point onward will look like. Go over what I need to do to get there.
  - Go over my constraints for the day.
    - This is normally things like. No reddit, no youtube, no phone on you while working.
-  8 am - 12 pm - Deep work
    - No distractions. No bullshit. Just get stuff done. If I don't know how to do something try like hell to figure it out yourself before asking for help. The phone shouldn't be in the room.
- 12 pm - 12:30 pm Lunch
  - Eat some lunch talk with the GF relax for a minute
- 12:30 pm - 5:00 pm - Shallow Work. 
  - Check email, be in meetings, try to get shit done, but let's be honest this time is about 3x less effective then those first hours of the morning. 
- 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm Dinner 
  - Eat hang out. Relax
- 6:00 pm - 8:00 pm - Deep Work
  - This deep work session is on personal projects. Looking at grad school. Social media. This blog. That kind of thing. The last 30 minutes of this is reserved for writing a daily.
- 8:00 pm - 9:30 pm - Relax and spend time with ffriends and family
- 9:30 pm - 10:00 pm - Read
  - It's important to limit screen time before sleep and to get the head ready for bed. This is normally fiction since I'm basically falling asleep as I'm reading.
- 10:pm pm - 6:00 am - SLEEP
  - The most important thing on this list. The data are clear. If you don't sleep you can't perform. High quality sleep is necessary every day. I can't do more thena few days consecutively of less than 8 hours before I start seeing it catch up to me.


And that's about it. Weekends are pretty different.
The workouts I have available at my gym are at different times. But I try to get in 6 hours of work and make at least two of that be deep work. Generally, that is all personal.

A lot of this was heavily inspired by Lex Friedman's daily routine. You can check out his version of it below.
